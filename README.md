This is the official PHP SDK for Prismic.io, providing a straightforward way to connect to Prismicâ€™s headless API. It is maintained by the community to help developers get started with Prismic in PHP.

-   Offers an easy-to-use interface for basic interactions with Prismic content
-   Covers core features of the Prismic API

## Getting started

### Installation

Installation using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md):

```bash
$ composer require prismic/php-sdk
```

### Recommended PHP Extensions

We recommend installing and enabeling the [APCu](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.apcu.php) extension to have the built-in default cache support. Otherwise, you can implement your own cache strategy by extending the `Prismic\Cache\CacheInterface` interface.

### Basic Usage & API calls

If you are not using automatic autoloading, include the Composer autoload file:

```php
<?php
include_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

use Prismic\Api;
```

Then you can start making your first API calls:

```php
$api = Api::get('https://your-repo-name.prismic.io/api/v2');
$document = $api->getByUID('get-started-type', 'get-started');
```

### DOM Helper

The PHP SDK provides a set of DOM helpers to help you render your Prismic content.

In these examples we have a document variable corresponding to the fetched Prismic document. We also have a $linkResolver variable containing the functional link resolver, [read our docs to learn more about Link Resolving](https://prismic.io/docs/php/beyond-the-api/link-resolving).

#### Link

```php
<?php
use Prismic\Dom\Link;

echo Link::asUrl($document->data->link, $linkResolver);
```

#### Rich Text

```php
<?php
use Prismic\Dom\RichText;

echo RichText::asText($document->data->title);
echo RichText::asHtml($document->data->description, $linkResolver);
```

#### Date

```php
<?php
use Prismic\Dom\Date;

$date = Date::asDate($document->data->date);
echo $date->format('Y-m-d H:i:s');
```
